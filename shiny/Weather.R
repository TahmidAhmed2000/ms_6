The weather data and game logs of players is sourced from the Github account, Nolanole. The data contains weather characteristics like average temperature, dewpoint, humidity, etc. Furthermore, I have joined the weather data and player statistics with stadium attendance to see how weather affects attendance of games. The attendance data is sourced from the Github profile, Rfordatascience. I am from New York and the Giants are my favorite team, and I thought it would be interesting to focus on my favorite team.
